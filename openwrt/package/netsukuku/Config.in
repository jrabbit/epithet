		Netsukuku is a mesh network or a P2P net system that generates and sustains
		itself autonomously. It is designed to handle an unlimited number of nodes with
		minimal CPU and memory resources. Thanks to this feature it can be easily
		used to build a worldwide distributed, anonymous and anarchical network,
		separated from the Internet, without the support of any servers, ISPs or
		authority controls.
