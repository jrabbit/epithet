==== 0.0.7b ====

New features:
	
	* Multi-inet-gateways. 
	  The Netsukuku nodes will now automatically use multiple
	  inet-gateways to connect to the Internet, therefore their Internet
	  connection will be effectively load-balanced.
	  
	* Anti-loop multi-igw shield. 
	  The nodes which share their Internet connection will also
	  automatically use the shared connection of the other nodes. Through
	  a simple marking system, death loops are avoided.
	  
	* Traffic shaping. The nodes which share their Internet connection can
	  now shape it, in this way they'll prioritize their local outgoing
	  traffic and the lowdelay one (f.e. SSH).

	* The lowdelay TOS is now set in the ANDNA resolve requests.


Bug fixes:
	
	* When all the rnodes die, the radar resets the qspn counters
	* Code cleaned
	* A lot of bugs, which you haven't and you will never heard, have been
	  fixed. We've already forgotten them.


==== 0.0.6b ====
	
New features:

	* The NTK_RFC 0008 has been implemented.
	  ( http://lab.dyne.org/Ntk_restricted_ip_classes )

Bug fixes:

	* The NTK_RFC 0007 has been implemented. It fixes an exploitable bug
	  in the ANDNA protocol.

	* NetsukukuD has been tested on big endian machines. A lot of
	  endianness bugs has been fixed during the tests and now it seems to
	  work gracefully.
	  A lot of thanks to Vampire ;*
	
	* The ppp connection to the Internet doesn't set an IP address in the
	  default route of the kernel but only the used ppp interface,
	  therefore NetsukukuD has to deduce it from the IP assigned to the
	  ppp interface, i.e. ppp0.

	* Execute /etc/netsukuku/ip_masquerade.sh only if it is
	  writable just by root.

	* Execute "/etc/netsukuku/ip_masquerade.sh stop" when NetsukukuD is
	  closed.

	* Added a timeout of 60 seconds for the reverse resolution request.

	* A possible memory overrun in the rsa (un)packing functions has been
	  fixed.


==== 0.0.5b  ====

New features:
	* The Internet Gateway Search (NTK_RFC 0003) has been implemented.
	  A node can now share its Internet connection among the other nodes
	  (only in restricted mode). 
	  ( Read the RFC: http://lab.dyne.org/Ntk_IGS )

	* Main part of the NTK_RFC 0001 written, the (g)nodes have now the
	  ability to rehook to avoid IP collision. 
	  ( http://lab.dyne.org/Ntk_gnodes_contiguity )
	  
	* ANDNS has been implemented. It is a new specification of the DNS
	  protocol for Netsukuku. It is compatible with the actual DNS
	  protocol. ( http://lab.dyne.org/Ntk_andna_and_dns )

	* Multi interfaces multipath: if we can reach a rnode trough multiple
	  interfaces, use them all with a multipath route.
	  
	* The dns_wrapper code is no more dependent on Boost.


Bug fixes:

	* map_rnode doesn't use anymore the timeval struct and map_rnode.rtt was
	  removed 'cause it was obsolete. In conclusion we gained 12 bytes for
	  each rnode.

	* Added a check in get_free_nodes to verify the validity of
	  fn_hdr->ipstart.
	  For example if the rnode has an IP which doesn't match with
	  fn_hdr->ipstart there must be some errors. This led to bug 0002.

	* Fixed a bug in the multiif code: the packets destined to gnodes were
	  sent only from the first device.

	* qspn_remove_deads() removes the routes of the dead nodes from the
	  routing table of the kernel.

	* Restricted nodes and normal nodes are now invisible to each other.

	* 127.0.0.0/8 banned.

	* The command line options override the ones specified in the config file.

	* code heavily cleaned.


==== 0.0.4b  ====

New features:

	* The multi-interface support was added, now it is possible to use
	  multiple network interfaces without the need of the bridge, just
	  specify each interface you want to use with the -i option. (man
	  netsukuku_d).

	* The multipath support has been enabled for the external map, this
	  means that more than one route will be used to reach a gnode. In other
	  words the load balacing has been fully enabled.

	* Endianness fixes: now the packets can be sent between two machines
	  with different endianness.
	  
	* When the daemon is launched /etc/resolv.conf is modified
	  automatically, so the "nameserver 127.0.0.1" is added in the first
	  line of resolv.conf. The old resolv.conf is at /etc/resolv.conf.bak.
	  When the daemon is closed /etc/resolv.conf.bak is moved to
	  /etc/resolv.conf.

	* Added CC and CXX options in Scontruct. 
	  Changes provided by Tero Auvinen.

	* At hooking the first radar_scan is retried for three times.


	* The Make/configure support was added. Now you can use both SCons or
	  Make to compile and install Netsukuku.


Bug fixes:

	* All the the packets are now sent without any alignment.

	* The free_nodes struct has been optimised: to keep the list of free
	  nodes it uses single bits instead of single bytes, this means that the
	  list is now of 32 bytes instead of 256.

	* The bug in the load_rh_cache code is now fixed. (It caused crashes
	  when the daemon was closed).
	  
	* The installation path of the man page is now fixed.

	* The installation paths are changed!! BIN_DIR=/usr/bin/,
	  MAN_DIR=/usr/man

	* The /usr/share/netsukuku directory is now created by the daemon
	  itself.

	* Now /sys/net/ipv4/conf/INTERFACE/rp_filter is automatically disabled
	  for the used network interface.

	* Errors in load_hostnames() fixed. (It crashed if there was an just
	  an empty '\n').

	

==== 0.0.3b  ====

	* The ANDNA code, with its DNS wrapper, is completed and tested.
		
	* The Netsukuku code was cleaned. Now it's ready to be an API.

	* The Italian to English translation of the document is finished.


==== 0.0.2b  ====

	* NetsukukuD goes beta!


==== 0.0.1b  ====

	* NetsukukuD compiles, at least.


==== 0.0.0a  ====

	* The void and its nulliness filled the existence.
