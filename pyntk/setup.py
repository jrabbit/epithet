'''
Netsukuku is a mesh network or a p2p net system that generates and sustains
itself autonomously. It is designed to handle an unlimited number of nodes
with minimal CPU and memory resources. Thanks to this feature it can be
easily used to build a worldwide distributed, anonymous and anarchical
network, separated from the Internet, without the support of any servers,
ISPs or control authorities.
