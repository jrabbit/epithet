 * int_info: this struct is used to keep the information about the int/short
 * variables present in a struct. It is useful to convert all the int/short
 * vars in another endian format with a simple function. 
 * WARNING: There is a drawback: the struct must have the __packed__
 * attribute (but since we are using this for packet structs we don't care).
 *
 * Here there is an example which show how to use this int_info:
 * 	
 * given the struct s:
 *	struct 
 *	{
 *		u_char a;
 *		int b;
 *		short c;
 *		char d[23];
 *		int e[4];
 *	}__attribute__ ((__packed__)) s;
 *
 * its int_info struct should be filled in this way:
 * 
 * int_info s_int_info = { 3,
 *  			   {INT_TYPE_32BIT, INT_TYPE_16BIT, INT_TYPE_32BIT}, 
 *			   { sizeof(char), sizeof(char)+sizeof(int), 
 *			   	sizeof(char)+sizeof(int)+sizeof(short)+sizeof(char)*23},
 *		           { 1, 1, 4 }
 *			 };
