##
#### Restricted mode
##

#
# If the `ntk_restricted_mode' option is set to 1, NetsukukuD will be started
# in restricted mode to allow the compatibility with Internet. In the
# restricted mode, are chosen only IPs of the largest private subnet, i.e.
# 10.x.x.x.
# If `ntk_restricted_class' is set to 1 the IPs will be chosen from the
# 172.16.0.0-172.31.255.255 range (use this option only if you are really
# can't use the 10.x.x.x class).
#
#ntk_restricted_mode	= 0
#ntk_restricted_class	= 0


##
#### Internet connection
##

#
# * * If you have an Internet connection please fill this options. * *
#
# We are assuming that you are running in restricted mode since you want to
# be both in Netsukuku and Internet. So, if you have an internet connection
# set `internet_connection' to 1.
#
# Set the `internet_gateway' option to the IP of the gateway you use to reach 
# the Internet and specify the network interface too, for example:
# "internet_gateway = 192.168.1.1:eth0". This option is necessary only if you
# don't have the default route set when you run NetsukukuD (i.e. you haven't
# connected yet), otherwise, leave it commented.
#
# You have also to set your upload and download bandwidth in 
# `internet_upload_rate' and `internet_download_rate'. It is expressed in Kb/s,
# so if you have a line which maximum can do: 640 Kb/s in dwload and 30 Kb/s in 
# upload, set them to 640 and 30.
#
# `internet_ping_hosts' is a list of Internet hosts which will be pinged to
# verify if the connection is alive, you can use the default hosts.
#
# Finally, If you want to share your Internet connection among other Netsukuku
# nodes, set `share_internet' to 1.
#
# Ah, and you can set `shape_internet' to 1 if you want to shape your outgoing
# Internet traffic.
# 
#internet_connection	= 1
#internet_gateway	= 192.168.1.1:eth0
internet_download_rate  = 640
internet_upload_rate	= 30
internet_ping_hosts	= google.com:cisco.com:sourceforge.net:dyne.org
#share_internet		= 1
#shape_internet		= 1


##
#### ANDNA
##

#
# To disable the start of the ANDNA daemon at the launch of netsukuku_d, set
# this option to 1. Note that when the ANDNA daemon is disabled, the andna
# system will not work at all, so it will be impossible to resolve, register
# or update hostnames.
#
#disable_andna		= 0

#
# When NetsukukuD starts it modifies /etc/resolv.conf writing in the first
# line "nameserver 127.0.0.1". The old /etc/resolv.conf is copied in
# /etc/resolv.conf.bak. When the daemon is closed /etc/resolv.conf is
# restored. If you want to disable this set disable_resolvconf to 1.
# If it is disabled you won't be able to resolve hostnames!
#
#disable_resolvconf	= 0


##
#### Limits
##

#
# How many connection the netsukuku daemons can simultaneusly handle.
#
#ntk_max_connections		= 512

# How many simultaneusly connections to the daemons from a single host are
# allowed.
#ntk_max_accepts_per_host	= 16

# The wait time necessary for a host to reconnect to the daemons after all the
# ntk_max_accepts_per_host were used.
#
#max_accepts_per_host_time	= 4	#in seconds
